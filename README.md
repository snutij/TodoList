# Todolist

Simple todolist application using Angular 7.

I made this application to learn Angular, it's really basic but it's only to begin with. Feel free to use it, read the code, optimise, all you want with this repo ! If you have any advice contact me !

# Features

* Add tasks
* Delete tasks.
* Mark as done/undone task.
* Move done items at the end.

For the design I took the [Saawsann](https://twitter.com/saawsann) css, the objective was to practice only Angular here. You can find his work [here](https://codepen.io/saawsan/pen/jayzeq?editors=0100).
